# MARS-COVID-19-Home-Safety-System
The code and libraries we used for our project is available here.

Master code is for the master arduino nano

SLave code is for the slave arduino nano

We have also provided the zip files for the libraries we used
If you do not have the libraries installed to your libraries folder then your code will not work

Thank You,
Team MARS
